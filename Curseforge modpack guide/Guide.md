## Step 4. Adding mods

Click the add content button. Now you'll see a list of mods, a searchbar, and the option to switch to different tabs like the Resource Packs, Data Packs, worlds and Shaders.

For example you want to play with shaders than if your modpack uses the fabric modloader you type "Iris" in the searchbar and click on install, and "Sodium" and click install.

For Forge you need to search for "Oculus" and "Embeddium" instead of "iris" and "Sodium"

<!--Step 4 1, Step 4 2, Step 4 3, Step 4 4, Step 4 5, -->

when you install the mods it takes a bit for them to install you can click on the down arrow button on the bottom left of the application to see if any mods and stuff are still downloading.

after that you can close the mod list by clicking on the X in the top right of the mods list.
